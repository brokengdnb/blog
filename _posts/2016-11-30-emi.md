> Never ever lost the passion for acomplishing your dreams, never ever... no matter of what? ... omg money? fuck the money... fight for your dreams!

So the idea was to create a special cusom high level mappings as well as dual-bind responsible skin to adapt on a events on a go but the point is... limited... number of a buttons... so it's like layer over the layer... over the another one... based on position in that mixing process. So I started from zero with tottaly different MIDI console, then emigrate but the idea is same and is portable to "any" device that I get under my hands, it just works. In this time "2020" Behringer-CMD serie... and yes, you can separate them and yes each of that console have their own layers and yes it works one by one but together.... omg... hold my beer baby... I will show you something...

## Code

The core is written in C++ by open source comunity Mixxx and I didn't touched that core, I took care about skin, mappings and comunication between controller, screen and audio. The magic script is written in pure Javasript ES5 with some deep dark energy and the best part is like:

```javascript
// e = encoder, b = button... c = cue??? no, what only 4 deck? common!
function deckApi(channel) {
    var cc = ['e1', 'e2', 'e3', 'e4', 'e5', 'e6', 'e7', 'e8', 'pitch', 'b1',
        'b2', 'b3', 'b4', 'b5', 'b6', 'b7', 'b8', 'load', 'lock', 'deck',
        'scratch', 'wheel', 'sync', 'tap', 'cue', 'playPause', 'backward',
        'forward', 'minus', 'plus'];

    var rings = [CC.E1, CC.E2, CC.E3, CC.E4, CC.E5, CC.E6, CC.E7, CC.E8];

    var buttons = [CC.B1, CC.B2, CC.B3, CC.B4, CC.B5, CC.B6, CC.B7, CC.B8,
        CC.LOAD, CC.LOCK, CC.SCRATCH, CC.SYNC, CC.TAP, CC.CUE, CC.PLAY_PAUSE,
        CC.BACKWARD, CC.FORWARD, CC.MINUS, CC.PLUS];

    var i, deck = {};
    for (i = 0; i < cc.length; i++) deck[cc[i]] = controlApi();
    deck.pitch.led = pitchLed(channel);

    for (i = 0; i < rings.length; i++)
      deck[CC_NAME[rings[i]]].led = encoderLedApi(channel, rings[i]);

    for (i = 0; i < buttons.length; i++)
      deck[CC_NAME[buttons[i]]].led = buttonLedApi(channel, buttons[i]);

    return deck;
  }
```



## Future

Get some single-board mini PC with LCD and create complete custom and standalone player powered by 5V power bank.
