I've just released version `2.0`. of everything. Versions in future will be updated few times per year based on futures and testing. New way of thinking, designing and creating will be faster, more effective and organized.

In this 'covid-19' times I make the biggest changes in my life including future path returning me back to school. Music university of sound engineering.

Next year 2021 somewhere in a middle I will be starting personal internet radio, based on free music without licencing. Some personal samples also podcasts with the most interesting people on this planet.

So far I need to put together `Room23` earn enough money to move, pay semester, finish and run the whole idea. It will take a time, but I will make it done.
